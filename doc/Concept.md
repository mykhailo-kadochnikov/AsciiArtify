|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------
|minicube|Minikube is software that allows users to run a k8s cluster of just a single node and on a local machine. It is cross-platform thus can be installed on Linux, Mac or Windows. It is quite fast to set up and good testing environment for developers to see how their containerized application will run on Kubernetes.<br> It is not meant for production, but to test applications and deployment settings to see how they fare before sending them to a production environment. Has >25.8k stars on GitHub.|- easy to setup and use;<br> - GUI availability;<br> - mounts code from the developer’s machine directly into the running k8s node;<br> - SIG (special interest group) support;<br> - platform-agnostic;<br> - kubectl context automatically set to the newly created cluster;<br> - addons;<br> - allows creating multiple instances in parallel;|- running on Podman is considered experimental;<br> - high resource demands;<br> - poor automation options - no configuration file;<br> - poor multi-node support;<br> - cannot be deployed in the cloud by default;<br> - unavailable as a managed service;<br> - not intended for hosting production-grade workloads;<br> - does not support IoT/edge;<br> - approach of spawning a VM which decreases the startup speed.|[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) | 
|kind|Kind is an acronym for “Kubernetes in Docker'' and was born from the idea to run Kubernetes on a container runtime (instead of a VM). Has >11.1k stars on GitHub.            |- solid Podman support;<br> - CNCF certified;<br> - platform-agnostic;<br> - faster startup speed:<br> - allows creating multiple instances in parallel;<br> - provides configuration files;<br> - ability to load a local images directly into the cluster;|- requires Docker to run Kubernetes clusters, which can impact performance.<br> - harder to learn and operate from the start| [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) |
|k3d|k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Lab’s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes. Has >4.1k stars on GitHub.|- quickly installed and runs on a local machine;<br> - ingress out of the box;<br> - platform-agnostic;<br> - lower resource consumption compared to minikube;<br> - fully CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation);<br> - provides the capability to mount code from the developer’s machine directly into the running Kubernetes node;<br> - designed to run production-level Kubernetes on local machines;<br> - a single binary of less than 50MB;<br> - kubectl context automatically set to the newly created cluster;<br> - provides a cluster configuration file in YAML;<br> - allows quickly deploy production-level Kubernetes in a local environments without much storage or network requirements;<br> - easily to create single and multi-node k3s clusters for seamless local development and testing;<br> - more suitable for Raspberry Pi, IoT, and Edge devices;<br> - provides the ability to create multi-node Kubernetes clusters, allowing testing of more complex scenarios.|- some features supported by official Kubernetes may be limited or not fully supported;<br> - VM based Kubernetes environment;<br> - more limited when it comes to deploying it on a development machine;<br> - has a smaller community and ecosystem compared to Minikube or Kind;<br>| [k3d](https://k3d.io/#getting-started) |

## Conclusions

Considering the risks that may arise with Docker licensing and considering the possibility of using an alternative to Podman, only one Kind provides solid Podman support. Thus, I recommend Kind as a further development tool of AsciiArtify.  

## Setup demo
![minicube create cluster](https://asciinema.org/a/eVlWBYTsbUs81dS3exrAJ7fI1)


![kind create cluster](https://asciinema.org/a/uKBi8gLjBbUMBi6vtbzxXLY3Y)

1. Install kind on a local machine
2. Create a Kubernetes cluster using `kind create cluster` command
3. Verify that the cluster is running using the `kubectl cluster-info` command
4. Deploy an example application using `kubectl create deployment` and `kubectl expose deployment` commands
5. Access the application using the `kubectl port-forward` command or `kubectl proxy` command
